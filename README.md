# Pong Game

This is a simple project that I made in 2011, as an school exercise, that I converted to use Tornado.

It uses WebSocket to realtime comunication and HTML5 Canvas for the graphics.

There are a lot of bugs on this project and I'm not sure if someday I will fix it, but it stills a good sample for Tornado and WebSockets.
